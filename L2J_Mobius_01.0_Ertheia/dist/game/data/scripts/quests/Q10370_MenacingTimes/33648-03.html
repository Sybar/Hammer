Quickly, you have to hunt down <font color="LEVEL">Grave Scarabs, Scavenger Scarabs, Grave Ants, Scavenger Ants, Shrine Knights</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Shrine Royal Guards</font> and bring me back samples of their <font color="LEVEL">Remnant Ashes</font>. To be on the safe side, please bring back 30 samples. They are already in the area so we must be quick before Shilen sends in her creations. Once I have these samples, it will help me determine if there is a threat to Goddard here or not.
