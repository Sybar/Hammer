<html><body>Seal of Shillien's Priest Kastor:<br>
The Seal of Shillien was created by Shunaiman, Elmoreden's first emperor, to block the path to Shillien's Sanctuary.<br>
Long ago, Shillien was exiled from heaven. In anguish and suffering, she birthed her monstrous children and then declared herself the goddess of death. As legend has it, since then the dead are looking for a way to Shillien's Sanctuary. They roamed those lands disturbing the living, until Shunaiman ordered to seal the sanctuary away and to build the Seal of Shillien.<br>
And now the bosses of Chaos along with their minions are trying to get to Shillien's Sanctuary through the rifts that have appeared in the Seal of Shillien. They are surely planning to occupy this place.<br>
