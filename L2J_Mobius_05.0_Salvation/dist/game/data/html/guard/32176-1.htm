Marksman Ambra:<br>
Kamael Village is the main community of the Kamael. For ages upon ages, they were unable to leave because of a powerful magical seal. But now that seal has been broken and they can come and go as they please.<br>
It's become quite a bustling place, in fact. The other races have established embassies here to facilitate cooperation against the forces of evil.<br>
That's a good thing, of course, but so much has happened so fast, with so many new people, that I find it all a little bewildering.<br>
