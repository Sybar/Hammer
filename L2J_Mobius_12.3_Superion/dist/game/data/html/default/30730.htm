<html><body>Witness Protector Jax:<br>
Traveler, sir. My name is Jax. I receive money and sell my swordsmanship. That is, my job is to protect children of nobles like you. Ah? You're not a noble person? So what!<br>
By the way a Dwarf has been killed here recently. Maybe you actually need a protector like me.<br>
