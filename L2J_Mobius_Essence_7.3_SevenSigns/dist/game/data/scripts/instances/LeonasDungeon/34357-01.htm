Welcome. This is Leona's Dungeon, a space that unfolds with my power and memory.<br>
This is a reenactment of my moment of awakening, and everything here will train you to become a hero.<br>
It may be more effective to train after transforming into my form if you are a wizard, are from a healer-type class, or a Sylph who cannot use a spear.<br>
